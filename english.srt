1
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:15,950
Salinger the Transcendent...

2
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:19,490
The Sovereignty's demon,
imprisoned 30 years ago.

3
00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:22,950
That's how the Emperor
explained you to me, but...

4
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:27,200
You sure do look young. Are you actually him?

5
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:31,370
You've got guts to speak to me like that.

6
00:00:31,370 --> 00:00:35,240
Does that confidence come from knowing
you have the Emperor's support?

7
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:37,200
Oh, no, not at all.

8
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:42,700
However, it is a pleasant surprise.
How did you manage to get in?

9
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:48,620
Through peaceful measures. I have
Sovereignty citizenship for times like this.

10
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:54,160
Anyway, I won't beat around the bush.
I'm here to help you escape from here.

11
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,040
Hmm.

12
00:00:56,040 --> 00:01:02,950
We're planning a large-scale invasion
and thought we could use your help.

13
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:04,330
Your objective?

14
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:08,200
The current queen, Millavair Lou Nebulis VIII.

15
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:13,830
She captured you when you fought
against the late queen, 30 years ago.

16
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:17,870
You want me to seek revenge? How dull.

17
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:23,700
However, I have grown
a little tired of living underground.

18
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:25,240
All right.

19
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:31,080
I suppose I'll go...

20
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,910
...to transcend into
something higher than a king.

21
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:57,590
Our Last Crusade or the Rise of a New World

22
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:15,790
You can't sleep either?

23
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:19,990
You must feel uneasy. After all,
this is a hostile territory for you.

24
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:25,080
No... I was just thinking how
peaceful the night view is.

25
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:29,040
It is, but not everything is as it seems.

26
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:34,080
Within the night view are
prisons that hold violent criminals.

27
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,580
You mean, dangerous astral mages?

28
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:42,040
No, not all violent criminals
have powerful astral spirits.

29
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,790
With one exception.

30
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:45,200
Exception?

31
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:51,450
One of the prison towers over there,
the Ollelugan Prison Tower.

32
00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:54,080
That facility has the highest level of security.

33
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:58,200
This nation's worst criminal is imprisoned
in the deepest level of that tower.

34
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:01,620
Salinger the Demon is held captive there.

35
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:03,830
Is that because he's a prisoner?

36
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:05,290
What do you mean?

37
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:07,990
Alice, you just called him a "demon."

38
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:12,120
I don't like using that term
either, but those are the rules.

39
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:16,700
Referring to himself as the Transcendent,
Salinger attacked the late queen.

40
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:22,120
Calling the traitor a demon is a stigma
for the subversion against the nation.

41
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:28,490
Jeez... I've said too much.
Don't tell Rin about this.

42
00:04:28,490 --> 00:04:31,700
If she finds out I've explained
to you about Salinger, she'll--

43
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:34,040
Lady Alice.

44
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:36,540
Why did you just scream?

45
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:40,410
Really, you need an
attitude fit for a princess...

46
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:43,660
That isn't important. Did something happen?

47
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:47,540
We have reason to believe someone
infiltrated our nation and crossed the border.

48
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:49,700
How could that be?

49
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:55,950
Huh? Don't look at me.
I'm in no condition to do anything.

50
00:04:55,950 --> 00:04:58,950
We know that. We've been
together the whole time.

51
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:04,290
Except for the Central Province,
suspicious groups were sighted in 12 provinces.

52
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:09,830
Since it could be the Empire's
covert force, a warning has been issued.

53
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:13,450
That also applies to this province, Alcatroz.

54
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:18,950
Have we been spotted?!

55
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:24,330
No, if we triggered this alarm,
it would've gone off when we got in.

56
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:26,410
Could it be Risya, then?!

57
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:29,950
Shh! Be quiet, Jhin, Mismis!

58
00:05:36,910 --> 00:05:38,120
Prison guards?

59
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:41,910
No, they're the prison's
emergency response team.

60
00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:44,700
Their gear is are exactly
like the Imperial Army's.

61
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:47,990
It's probably outfitted to handle
astral mages in this prison.

62
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:51,580
Yeah, I don't think they're after us.

63
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:56,580
That could mean Risya's in trouble!
This is bad! We have to go help her!

64
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:01,200
It's shaking!

65
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,370
What now?

66
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:08,290
Ah, hello? Hey, Mismis, you doing okay?

67
00:06:08,290 --> 00:06:09,870
Risya?!

68
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:15,490
Oh, good! I guess you're safe!
Did you guys hear the sound just now?

69
00:06:15,490 --> 00:06:17,790
A wall was blown to access under the ground,

70
00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:22,240
and then an earth astral spirit
blasted a big hole to the top!

71
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:25,200
I mean, wow! Astral art is incredible!

72
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:30,290
H-Hold on, Risya! What happened to Iska?

73
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:35,040
Ah, sorry about that, Mismis.
Apparently, Iska isn't here.

74
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:41,830
Instead, there was a big bad demon who
went on a rampage, causing chaos. Oops!

75
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:44,330
Uhh, okay, well...

76
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:50,160
So, everyone retreat! Try not to
get captured by the prison guards!

77
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,660
What is she thinking?!

78
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:58,700
You can complain later. Let's go.

79
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:03,200
Jhin, do you think she used us as bait?

80
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:05,790
There's no point in thinking about it.

81
00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:14,700
We'll break into Pattern Beta.
Unit B, go from the right.

82
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:14,280
The problem is them.

83
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:15,790
Yes, sir.

84
00:07:15,790 --> 00:07:16,740
Unit C, go left.

85
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:18,490
Yes, sir.

86
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:22,410
We're trapped.

87
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:26,870
That Miss Saint Disciple should've
communicated two minutes sooner!

88
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:35,700
What's going on over there?

89
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:37,620
Explosion?

90
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:41,450
Understood.

91
00:07:41,450 --> 00:07:45,580
Lady Alice, there's been an explosion
at the Ollelugan Prison Tower.

92
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:48,490
A giant hole in the ground
was created at the site,

93
00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:51,790
blasting out huge amount of debris.

94
00:07:51,790 --> 00:07:54,620
Furthermore, according to
the tower's prison guard,

95
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:59,990
they heard a large roar
near Salinger the Demon's cell.

96
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:01,410
What did you say?!

97
00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:05,580
We're currently trying to reach
the emergency response team there.

98
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:09,370
We need to act quickly, Rin!
If that demon escapes...

99
00:08:09,370 --> 00:08:12,080
...he'll go after Mother's astral spirit next!

100
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:14,160
Go after an astral spirit?

101
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,240
I'll head over there.

102
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:19,660
But Lady Alice! He's dangerous!

103
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:21,700
Who else could stop him?

104
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:23,200
Ah...

105
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:29,790
Rin, go to the ground floor.
Prepare our vehicle immediately.

106
00:08:29,790 --> 00:08:32,120
Understood.

107
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:40,120
As you just heard, I'll be
heading out to the prison tower.

108
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:44,580
But you can't give me,
an imperial soldier, the details, right?

109
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:47,990
That's right. You're our enemy.

110
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:54,240
But if I could tell you everything,
it would feel so reassuring...

111
00:08:55,200 --> 00:09:03,870
Hey, Iska... If I ask for your help,
would you accept my request?

112
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:05,910
Huh?

113
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:09,620
Never mind. I'm going to get changed.

114
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:17,740
Do you remember this?

115
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:21,790
You might think I'm rude to give
this to you at a time like this, but...

116
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:24,330
I wanted to do it when Rin wasn't around.

117
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:29,330
I got the handkerchief you gave me dirty, so...

118
00:09:29,330 --> 00:09:31,950
I'm sorry it had to be replaced with a new one.

119
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:38,740
If you don't like it,
you can just leave it behind.

120
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:43,990
But I hope you do like it and take it.

121
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:45,790
Goodbye, Iska.

122
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:53,450
Alice?

123
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:06,990
There's no way we can take them head on.
Nene, Boss, you two stay here.

124
00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:09,370
I'll go out and attract their attention.

125
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:13,490
When they have their guard down,
take them out in a single sweep. Got it?

126
00:10:13,490 --> 00:10:20,120
Wait! You'd be better at doing
that, Jhin! I should be the bait.

127
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:24,330
Who'd be better at grabbing
their attention, you or me?

128
00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:27,290
B-But that's...

129
00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:29,160
I'll be the bait.

130
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,580
What?

131
00:10:33,490 --> 00:10:36,450
Because right now, I'm a witch.

132
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:39,200
Captain...

133
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,540
Hey, Boss, you don't mean...?

134
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:45,950
There are a bunch of witches
captured in this prison.

135
00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:48,370
Then...!

136
00:10:48,370 --> 00:10:51,490
I-I'm finally free!

137
00:10:51,490 --> 00:10:53,120
We've found an escapee!

138
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,290
Is this witch responsible for that blast?!

139
00:10:55,290 --> 00:10:59,790
An astral crest on her shoulder...
Everyone, in position!

140
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:06,240
Don't move! My astral spirit will
take all of you down in one attack!

141
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:09,160
It's a really powerful astral spirit!

142
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:12,330
We'll show no mercy to an escapee witch.

143
00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:16,160
Under Article 19 of the general
prison law, you will be executed!

144
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,740
All units, advance!

145
00:11:23,370 --> 00:11:26,580
This is something only I can do!

146
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:38,950
I'm not going to die here!

147
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:42,740
Over there!

148
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:45,080
They went around?!

149
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:56,990
Save us the trouble, escapee.

150
00:11:56,990 --> 00:12:03,620
Or should I say, escapee-flunky?
If we can execute you here, we'd--

151
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,740
Hit the floor in situations like this.

152
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:18,700
They were the last of them on this floor.

153
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:26,740
Nene! I was so scared! A few seconds
later and I would've been a goner!

154
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:31,830
For once, you were actually helpful,
Boss. You did good, for once.

155
00:12:31,830 --> 00:12:34,080
That doesn't sound like a praise!

156
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:38,160
Anyway, let's get out of here!

157
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:43,040
We'll all make it out okay
and force Risya to buy us barbeque!

158
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,580
Including Iska's meal?

159
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:46,410
Of course!

160
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:51,450
What exactly is going on?!

161
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:55,580
If only I didn't have this!

162
00:12:57,290 --> 00:13:00,450
A phone call? From where?

163
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:12,450
That's mine! Alice had it with her?

164
00:13:12,450 --> 00:13:13,450
Hello?

165
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:15,790
Oh, Iska?

166
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:17,830
Captain! It's me!

167
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:21,410
This is great! I finally got
a hold of him, Jhin, Nene!

168
00:13:21,410 --> 00:13:24,830
Stop wasting time and cut to the chase.

169
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:30,580
Iska, what's your situation like?

170
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:35,120
I'm not sure, but there's no one around me.

171
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:38,540
I'm captured on a hotel's top floor.

172
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:41,040
I see. And the Ice Calamity Witch?

173
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:44,240
She headed out, to the Ollelugan Prison Tower.

174
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:48,370
Ollelugan...? That's where we are.

175
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:52,620
What?! Hold on, Captain!
Why are you inside the Sovereignty?!

176
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:57,490
Jhin, Nene, I have bad news!
The Ice Calamity Witch is headed our way!

177
00:13:57,490 --> 00:13:59,330
Give me that.

178
00:13:59,330 --> 00:14:04,950
Iska. I'll explain later, but we're
here inside the Sovereignty.

179
00:14:04,950 --> 00:14:06,790
Just focus on finding us.

180
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:08,540
Roger that.

181
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:10,740
Can you go outside?

182
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:14,790
To be honest, probably not,
especially with me being handcuffed.

183
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:17,240
Any way you can break free from the handcuffs?

184
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:23,160
I would've if I could. Besides,
there's nothing to get these off...

185
00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:40,330
You didn't... Alice...

186
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:53,410
I see...

187
00:14:53,410 --> 00:14:55,370
I'm such an idiot.

188
00:14:55,370 --> 00:14:58,450
How could I not have figured this out?

189
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:07,870
I'll be right over. Don't worry...

190
00:15:07,870 --> 00:15:11,700
Iska... Hey, Iska. What's wrong?!

191
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:16,830
Jhin, stay there at Ollelugan.
I'll be on my way soon.

192
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:25,990
Lady Alice, we'll be there soon.

193
00:15:25,990 --> 00:15:28,910
Okay. Put your game face on.

194
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:33,120
Are we under fire from the Imperial Army?!

195
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,740
They're aiming for us! Please escape!

196
00:15:42,330 --> 00:15:46,830
The cell in Prison Tower
basement 11 has been destroyed!

197
00:15:46,830 --> 00:15:49,410
We believe Salinger the Demon has escaped!

198
00:15:49,410 --> 00:15:51,700
Never mind that! Where are the fire fighters?!

199
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:55,830
Get the onlookers out of here!
Imperial soldiers may be within them!

200
00:15:57,290 --> 00:16:01,120
If this damage was caused by the Imperial Army,

201
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:04,700
how did they cross the border?

202
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:06,790
It seems they've outsmarted us.

203
00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:12,620
The problem isn't just Salinger's escape...
They caused a series of commotion.

204
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:17,660
Bring it on. We'll just resolve
them one at a time.

205
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,370
Contain the blaze.

206
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:30,240
Show your respect!
Do you not recognize who she is?!

207
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,160
Princess Aliceliese?!

208
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,830
W-Why are you here?

209
00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:40,040
As the second princess,

210
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:43,870
I will assume full command
on behalf of Queen Nebulis.

211
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:48,490
All units will follow
my orders. I will lead you.

212
00:16:48,490 --> 00:16:50,790
As you wish!

213
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:51,870
Rin.

214
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:53,660
I am prepared.

215
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:57,990
We don't have time. It'll be dangerous,
but I can only count on you.

216
00:16:57,990 --> 00:17:02,580
The emergency response team
won't be able to stop Salinger.

217
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:06,370
I understand. I will not fail you.

218
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:17,200
The fire isn't from an astral spirit...
Could it be a firebomb?

219
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:20,990
Iska!

220
00:17:20,990 --> 00:17:23,200
Captain! Nene! Jhin!

221
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:29,330
Ah, I'm so relieved! I'm so sorry!
If only I was strong enough...!

222
00:17:29,330 --> 00:17:33,540
N-Not at all. That was completely my fault.

223
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:36,700
The fire will get us
if we don't hurry. Let's go!

224
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:40,040
Ah, hold on, Jhin. Captain, Nene, you, too.

225
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:41,790
What is it?

226
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:47,160
Captain, can I have my astral swords back?

227
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:50,040
Oh... Here you go.

228
00:17:56,410 --> 00:17:59,490
Captain, I need 15 minutes.

229
00:17:59,490 --> 00:18:00,410
Huh?

230
00:18:00,410 --> 00:18:04,660
Please take everyone behind
that big hotel and stay there.

231
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:06,660
I'll meet you there!

232
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:07,870
H-Hold on!

233
00:18:07,870 --> 00:18:09,740
Iska!

234
00:18:14,410 --> 00:18:16,370
Salinger, where are you?!

235
00:18:16,370 --> 00:18:20,120
How disappointing.

236
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:23,990
I was expecting a welcome
with cheering and clapping.

237
00:18:23,990 --> 00:18:27,620
Instead, I just get one measly girl?

238
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:33,580
Salinger!

239
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:39,160
Oh? You may look like a maid,
but your form tells me otherwise.

240
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:41,450
You're no ordinary maid.

241
00:18:41,450 --> 00:18:44,120
I will not introduce myself to a criminal!

242
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:50,580
A traitor who tried to steal the queen's
astral spirit! For that barbarous act--

243
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:52,290
you deserve to die!

244
00:18:52,290 --> 00:18:55,120
Steal? This is collection.

245
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:58,540
Being thought of as theft
is downright offensive.

246
00:18:58,540 --> 00:18:59,700
What?

247
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:02,540
A king collects tax from his people.

248
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:08,910
How is that any different from an
astral mage king collecting astral spirits?

249
00:19:08,910 --> 00:19:10,620
You're pretending to be king?

250
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:14,290
For now, I'm just a king.

251
00:19:14,290 --> 00:19:19,370
Once I gain all astral spirits,
I will become more powerful than a king.

252
00:19:19,370 --> 00:19:20,950
Silence, demon!

253
00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:25,240
You're just a criminal who stole
countless astral spirits and astral art!

254
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:29,540
Not even in 1,000 years
will you transcend the royal blood!

255
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:31,370
You know nothing.

256
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:34,160
I will not listen to your reasoning!

257
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:37,700
You're going back to your prison cell!

258
00:19:40,370 --> 00:19:42,410
A wind astral spirit?

259
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:49,990
Not bad for a maid.

260
00:19:51,330 --> 00:19:57,700
Clod of earth, crush this man.
Crush his annoying face into a pulp!

261
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:05,160
Golem? I see, so you're an earth astral mage.

262
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:23,580
But so fragile.

263
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:34,490
I'll cover you in dirt.
How fitting for a criminal.

264
00:20:52,790 --> 00:20:57,370
The earth astral spirit I wield
is that of the purebreds.

265
00:20:57,370 --> 00:21:01,660
Your astral spirit has no chance against mine.

266
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:06,990
You're saying you stole from the royal family?!

267
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:13,990
Salinger! Not even 100 violent
deaths can atone for your sin!

268
00:21:13,990 --> 00:21:16,870
Stop your barking!
Just look at the royal family now.

269
00:21:16,870 --> 00:21:19,120
Born into their social status,

270
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:23,490
they lack the will to elevate their
powerful astral spirits even higher.

271
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:26,290
How is that a worthy king?

272
00:21:26,290 --> 00:21:30,450
That is why I aim to be better.

273
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:35,240
Sing for me.

274
00:21:39,990 --> 00:21:46,240
How boring. I feel like
I'm torturing a dog or a cat.

275
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:50,240
You still dare to glare at me in your condition?

276
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:52,660
Then let me finish you off.

277
00:21:57,580 --> 00:21:59,700
What...?

278
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:02,990
He slashed through my invisible blast?

279
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:06,660
Imperial swordsman... You...

280
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:09,370
I'll help you just this once.

281
00:22:09,370 --> 00:22:14,120
This white-haired guy is Alice's enemy, right?

282
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:20,080
Paradise:
The Transcendent Demon
